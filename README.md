About This Project 🚀🤖

Chatbot Interaction Insights and Analysis 📊💬
Welcome to the Chatbot Interaction Insights and Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of chatbot interactions using Power BI and Python (Jupyter Notebook). The project aims to provide deep insights into user engagement, sentiment trends, and demographic patterns.

Project Highlights 🌟
Power BI Dashboard: An interactive dashboard that visualizes key metrics such as total interactions, user age distribution, sentiment analysis, and interactions over time.
Python Analysis: Jupyter Notebook scripts that perform detailed data analysis and visualization, including statistical analysis and graphical representation of the dataset.

Features 🔍
Total Interactions: A KPI card showing the total number of chatbot interactions.
Average User Age: Insights into the average age of users interacting with the chatbot.
Sentiment Distribution: Analysis of user sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) during interactions.
User Demographics: Visual representation of user demographics, including age and location.
Temporal Trends: Analysis of interaction trends over time.

Tools Used 🛠️
Power BI: For creating interactive and dynamic visualizations.
Python: For data analysis and visualization using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and visualization scripts.

How to Use 📘
Power BI Dashboard:

Open the Power BI file included in this repository.
Explore various visualizations and interact with the dashboard to gain insights.
Python Analysis:

Open the Jupyter Notebook files.
Run the cells to perform data analysis and visualize the results.

Dataset 📁
The dataset used in this project, "Chatbot Interactions Dataset," contains data on chatbot interactions, including user demographics, sentiment scores, and interaction timestamps.

Future Work 🔮
Enhance the dashboard with more interactive features.
Implement machine learning models to predict user sentiment based on interaction patterns.
Expand the dataset to include more diverse user interactions.
